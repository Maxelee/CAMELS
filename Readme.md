**CAMELS** stands for **C**osmology and **A**strophysics with **M**achin**E** **L**earning **S**imulations. 

The CAMEL simulations are described in detail in the CAMELS presentation paper, [2010.00619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00619).

This repository contains the codes and scripts we wrote to carry out the analysis of the CAMELS presentation paper.

Further details on how to access the CAMELS data can be found on the webpage: [https://www.camel-simulations.org](https://www.camel-simulations.org).
