VIDE Voids
==========

For each hydrodynamic simulation we have identified voids in the galaxy distribution at redshift 0 with the `VIDE <https://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Home>`_ void finder. 

The data is organized as follows:

- **IllustrisTNG**: This folder contains the void catalogues of all the simulations of the IllustrisTNG LH set.

- **SIMBA**: This folder contains the void catalogues of all the simulations of the SIMBA LH set.

For each void catalogue we provide a folder with the standard VIDE output that is described `here <https://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Void%20Catalogs%20&%20Analysis>`_.
